Pick up and complete “Encroaching Wildlife” 
Turn it in and accept “The lost Caravan.”
Head north and pick up every quest from The Harborage lost ones quest hub.
While heading east, find “Noboru the Cudgel” who drops a *quest starter* grey mace. 
Do all 5 quests up in the Fallow Sanctuary area, including the escort and looting crates on the ground for another *quest starter*.
Turn everything in and accept follow-ups, then return to the Northeast corner of the zone to complete “Driftwood”
Kill the elementals that drop the quest item for “Mazen's Behest” on the way to do driftwood and on the way back. Be warned that this quest item has a very low drop rate, can be skipped if it doesn’t drop while completing other quests.
Turn in “Driftwood” and accept “Deliver the Shipment.”
We now have 3 quests to turn in at Nethergarde keep, travel over to the keep via Blasted Lands and turn everything in and grab the flight path.
At 41 equip the white francisca axe in mainhand, black water hammer in offhand, use windfury on both, and learn stormstrike from talents. 
Fly down to Booty Bay, *don’t* reset hearth, keep it in South Shore.
