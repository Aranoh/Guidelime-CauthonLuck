[N20-23 Bloodmyst Isle]
Hearth back to Exodar.
Start the water totem quest and train level 20 skills. Use frost shock and frostbrand weapon as your main shock/weapon enchant now that we’re using the ice staff.
Your next talent points at lvl 21 and 22 go into improved ghost wolf now that we’ve unlocked it.
Fly to Bloodwatch and pick up all the quests again + *Set Hearth*
*note* Basically just do every quest remaining here, except for “the sun gate” and “ending the blood curse” Order doesn’t matter too much, just prioritize the lower level quests first while making a circular route around the zone, two large quest circuits total.
Circuit 1: Do the quests directly west of Bloodwatch with the lower level 16-18 mobs first (ravagers/lashers/spiders etc), finish Galen’s quest chain if you didn’t earlier, then north to the saytar area. Finish everything there, the bear quests, then the water totem/murloc quests. Click the *quest starter* map in inventory after turning in the final murloc quests to the gnome. Do the northeast island quest chains. After killing the elite dragon (use grounding totem for fear/interrupt breath) swim back with the swim speed buff to turn in “A map to where?”
Mass turn in quests/accept new ones in town then finish up the followups to “A map to where” which are close to Bloodwatch. 
Circuit 2: *optional* Prior to starting the final quest circuit, there are 2 elite quests that can be done together “Ending their World” and “Clearing the Way.” These can be soloed, but it can be difficult and you may need to heal the escort npc and/or gift of the naaru him depending on how he pulls. If you intend to do these, (I’ll be attempting to do them in my run) be sure to pick up one of the +5 stamina buffs and a ton of food/drinks now in town, you’ll have to quickly spam food/drink after nearly every pull to keep topped off as the escort charges into new mobs.
Finish the remaining handful of quests to the northwest, turning in all quests that have their turn-in npc outside of Bloodwatch, then ending with the shaman water totem turn-in way out in the ocean to the north. After turning that in and taking the next step, hearth back to Bloodwatch for the final quest turn-ins. Train new ranks of first aid, fly to Exodar for new class skills, then take the boat back over to Darkshore.
