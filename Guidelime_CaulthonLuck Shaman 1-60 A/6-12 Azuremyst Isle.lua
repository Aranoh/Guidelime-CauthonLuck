[N6-12 Azuremyst Isle]
Run west to exit the starting area, grab the delivery quest and “Red snapper, very tasty.”
Do about half of the red snapper quest (if area is crowded, just finish it all now and turn-in if you can.) while traveling north then slightly northwest.
Kill a cat for the faintly glowing crystal *quest starter*, then deathwarp or walk to Azure watch. Wait to turn in any quests here until later. 
*note* The purpose of this is to make sure you are level 6 instead of level 7 for the next few quests. You’ll get way more xp overall by being level 6 while killing a bunch of level 5 and 6 mobs, the xp from quests just gets banked for later to get us to 8.
Pick up all quests in Azure Watch and buy the vendor staff, you can start using the strength elixirs you got from that earlier quest now, we’re done deathwarping for a while. 
Finish most of the stag/lasher quests “The great moongraze hunt” and “Medicinal Purpose.” Prioritize the lashers, you need to kill way more of them to complete the quest.
When done or almost done with those, grab 2 more quests from beach camp. Grind on crabs while traveling west to the “small start” quest items.
Pick up the items, then finish collecting the crab meat on the way back to the beach camp and turn those quests in/accept all follow-ups.
Finish “I’ve got a plant” just north of the camp and turn it in/take followup, then finish any remaining stag/lasher items needed while heading north back to town. 
Get to within 2100xp of 8 - turn everything in at Azure Watch and you’ll hit lvl 8. *Set hearth*. Need 6s70c for all sham skills. Use any extra money to buy bags.
Pick up all the new quests, read the book to learn furbolg language from your inventory, then grab the “Totem of Coo” followup.
Grind north towards the lvl 7 & 8 bucks/cats, picking up the herbs by trees when you can. Finish most of the cats/bucks and do the totem of coo line. Finish up the red snapper quest once you have the swim speed buff.
Finish travel portion of totem of coo, which takes you to the western side of the island, then do the furbolg key quest.
Finish the cat/buck quests here if needed, then do the 2 naga quests to the south, to kill 5 of each naga type, and to pick up the artifacts. 2 *quest starter* items to look for here, one from stealthed blood elf, one from naga. Don’t worry if you can’t find the stealthed blood elf, there aren’t many spawns and the quest doesn’t lead to anything else, it’s just a bit of bonus xp if you happen to find one.
Swim out to island for the tree disguise quest, can afk 2 min while the npcs do their RP here before running to the south of the island.
Turn in “The missing fisherman” on dock to the south then do his follow-up quest “all that remains.” 
Turn it in then hearth back to Azure Watch, if your hearth is down for some reason or you forgot to set it, just die to the owlbeasts and spirit rez back by Azure Watch.
Turn/accept new quests at Azure Watch and the beach camp to the south. Keep the shield quest reward you get here, we will be using 1h/shield with flametongue till 16.
Kill the gnome wandering the beach to the south for “Show Gnomercy” and take 1h mace as reward from it - equip it with flametongue and put on the shield.
Return to Azure Watch, should be a ways into level 10 at this point, so pick up the shaman class quest and train new skills. 
Here’s a look at the talent build I recommend for this 1-60 guide, 44 points in Enhancement first. https://tbc.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/25-500523010500133531151
Here’s a clip showing the order I take them: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1026525402
Stock up on bags and lvl 5 food/drink with extra money and head straight north to pick up murloc/ravager quests, skilling up 1h mace as you go on the lower level mobs.
Do murloc grain quest on the west coast first, get *quest starter* from the named murloc.
Grind east, turning in the 2 murloc quests on the way over to the fire elemental, finishing ravager hides, and continue the shaman questline.
After finishing and turning in murloc/ravager quests and taking followups, you will have 3 quests to do in the cave to the north all at once.
Complete those 3 and then do the follow-up quest for kurken lurkin’ back in the cave.
Should be close to 12 now, turn in all quests and then from the fire elemental, go northwest to the bridge into bloodmyst. Grind mobs along the way to get closer to 12.
