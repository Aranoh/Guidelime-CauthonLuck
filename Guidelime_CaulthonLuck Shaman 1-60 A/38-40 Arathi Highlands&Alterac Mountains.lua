[N38-40 Arathi Highlands&Alterac Mountains]
Upon landing in southshore, turn in/accept all quests.
Try to kill some of the assassins around town for the *quest starter* item if you haven’t gotten it already. *note* The assassins only attack the town sporadically, with sometimes hours between sightings. If you happen to run into them during all the times we pass through southshore, great, but don’t wait around hoping they’ll show up.
Turn in “Magical Analysis” and accept “Ansirem’s Key”
Do “Crushridge Bounty.”
Do “Preserving Knowledge” If you found the *quest starter* for “An Old History Book” while in Duskwood you’ll have this quest, it’s the last step in the chain, but don’t worry if you never found the book, it’s a low drop chance from any mob in Duskwood.
Optional - Look for the rare spawn Lo’Grosh while up by his 2 spawn points in alterac mountains, his drops are all pretty good for this level range.
Do “Noble Deaths”
Do “Dark Council”
Do “Baron’s Demise” if you found the *quest starter* letter from the assassins.
Recall back to southshore to turn everything in/take follow-ups. 
Waterwalk down to Faldir’s Cove in Arathi 
Do every quest down in this water area, making use of water walking/water breathing skills for faster completion.
Be sure to take the “Black Water Hammer” reward from “Deep sea Salvage,” this will be our new mainhand weapon for now. Hold onto the old blue axe for when we get dual wield at 40.
When all quests from the cove are done, return to refuge point and accept every available quest.
Work on “Worth its weight in gold” first, it’s a lvl 36 quest, but the mobs you have to kill can be in the low 30s, so it’s an optimal time to level up your 1h mace skill while doing this quest.
Turn that quest in, accept the follow up “Wand over Fist” and go do that.
Turn it in, accept “Trelane’s defenses” and head over to Stormguarde Keep. 
Do all 4 quests we have for this area then turn them in/grab follow ups etc..
Fly to stormwind to train 40 skills, get mail gear out of the bank. Learn dual wield from talents and use the black water hammer with windfury in main hand, and the blue axe in offhand with flametongue for now.
Fly to Duskwood and pick up “Supplies for Nethergarde” quest, then run into Swamp of Sorrows.
