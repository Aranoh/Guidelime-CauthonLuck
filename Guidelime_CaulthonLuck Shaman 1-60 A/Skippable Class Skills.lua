If you didn’t already have gold ahead of time to buy your mount at level 30, at this point you want to be saving up as much as possible (need just under 40g total) for your mount.
If money is an issue, as it will be for me, here’s a general outline on which skills can be skipped while leveling.
*Elemental Combat:*\\Fire nova/Magma Totem and Chain lightning can be skipped. You’ll eventually want rank 1 Magma totem for killing mobs that spawn 1hp adds, but not till late 40s.\\Chain lightning is situationally useful, but not too often, can be skipped until money is no longer an issue. 
*Enhancement:*\\Skip all of the resistance totems and the farsight/sentry totems. \\Additionally, you can stop leveling up frostbrand weapon after rank 1, and rockbiter after rank 3.
*Restoration:*\\Skip tranquil air totem and ancestral spirit unless doing dungeons 1-60. \\Can skip healing stream totem after rank 1 (always use mana spring totem over healing stream once you unlock it.) \\Once you get lesser healing wave, you can skip ALL other healing spells from that point onwards unless doing dungeons. I mainly just use shaman heals as an “oh, shit” button, so you only need the fastest casting heal. Gift of the nauru/bandages/food & drinks are usually more efficient than using mana to heal unless you have nearly full mana and low health, which is a rarity until much later levels.
