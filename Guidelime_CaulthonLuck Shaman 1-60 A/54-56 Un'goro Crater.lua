[N54-56 Un'goro Crater]
Pick up “The apes of un’goro” and “The fare of Lar’korwi”
Pick up “It’s a secret to everybody” to the northwest at the ruined raft.
Grab the next step from the lake right next to it for part 2.
Get the meat from the threshadon carcass to the north east, then turn in “The fare of Lar’korwi” and accept “The scent of Lar’korwi”
Step on the raptor eggs to the northwest and kill the mob that spawns twice for the quest items then turn it in and accept the last step “The bait for lar’korwi.”
Do “The bait for lar’korwi,” it’s a lvl 56 mob but not too hard, then continue north, we’ll turn the quest in later.
Do your best to pick up 7 crystals of each color while working your way up through the zone, you’ll want to finish asap so you can unlock the pylon quests.
Continue north and do “The apes of un’goro.”
Keep an eye out for the *quest starter* item “a mangled journal,” it should drop by the time you’re done with the apes quest.
Head up to Marshal’s refuge, pick up every quest, turn in every quest/take followup, and grab flight path.
We’re going to do 2 huge circuits of the zone, completing all quests except for “chasing a-me 01,” but if you buy the mithril casing off the AH ahead of time, you can add that in too. *note* “Super Sticky” and “Muigin and Larion” can be skipped as well, if you’re not behind on xp. Both these quests have very low drop rates and can take 40+ kills to finish each one - plus the tar beasts disarm. 
Go counterclockwise completing the majority of the objectives, and picking up “Finding the source.” The only things we absolutely have to complete on this first circuit are the following:
Collect 7 of each crystal color if you haven’t already
Turn in “The bait for lar’korwi” and “The apes of un’goro,” 
Pick up “The mighty u’cha”
Complete all the quests on the volcano in center of the map, and end the circuit with “A little help from my friends” escort.
Turn whatever you ended up finishing in at Marshal’s Refuge, and make sure to grab all the pylon quests that follow up turning in the crystals.
Do the second circuit, this time going clockwise, and we will finish every remaining quest in the zone that didn’t get complete or was only partially finished on the last circuit.
Start with “The mighty U’cha,” then make sure to turn that quest and “Finding the source” in while finishing your clockwise circuit to complete all un-finished quests in the zone.
When back at Marshal’s Refuge with all the quests complete, turn everything in and then fly to Gadgetzan and turn in the 2 quests there, skip the followup. 
Hearth to Ratchet and turn in “Volcanic Activity.”
Fly to Southern Felwood (emerald sanctuary)
