[N30-32 Wetlands&Ashenvale]
Turn in the missing diplomat quest in the inn and do the follow-up, which has you fight a guy trying to sneak out of the inn. Go to the inn entrance and burst Tapoke Slim down to 30%, don’t worry about his add, once Tapoke is low they go neutral. 
Continue the missing diplomat line here in the inn until the point where the next step wants you to go to theramore, we’ll continue the questline later.
Turn in “The Doomed Fleet” and accept “Light forged Iron”
Complete that iron collection quest from the murlocs next to town and turn in/grab next step from that same npc in the inn.
*Set Hearth* at the wetlands inn, then boat over to Darkshore.
Fly all the way to the Forest Song quest hub in Eastern Ashenvale. You should still have the quests “Raene’s Cleansing” and “Fallen sky lake” from earlier, but if not, stop by Astranaar to pick them up.
Pick up all the quests here, we won’t do all of them, but can just abandon the others later when we leave the zone. 
Do “The lost chalice.”
Turn in “Vile Satyr!” at the dead dryad.
Accept and then do “The branch of Cenarius.”
Return to the quest hub and turn in “The branch of Cenarius,” accept “Satyr slaying!”
Skip over the orc lumber camp quests, they take too long, and head to Felfire Hill.
Do “Reclaiming Felfire Hill.” While doing this, kill a succubus for the *quest starter* item “Diabolical Plans.” This should be a 100% drop if you have “Destroy the Legion.”
*optional* Complete Destroy the Legion while in the area if there’s a nice mix of the infernals/fel guards/succubi. Sometimes there’s way too many of one type and barely any of the others due to respawn rng, so just skip it if that’s the case.
Do “Forsaken Diseases.” 
Do “Fallen Sky Lake.”
Head north and do “Satyr slaying!” near the entrance to felwood, these ones are much easier than the ones by the quest hub.
Do “Raene's Cleansing”
Do “The howling vale”
Run north into Felwood to the Emerald Sanctuary and grab the flightpath, high level area so stay clear of the mobs and/or slow them and zip away in ghost wolf. (skip this step on hardcore and just run back to Forest Song)
Fly back to the Forest Song quest hub in east ashenvale. 
Turn everything in, do not do ANY of the follow up quests.
Fly back to Astranaar and turn in “Fallen sky lake.”
Run northeast of town and turn in “Raene’s Cleansing,” skip followups, then hearth/recall back to the Wetlands. (remember to abandon unwanted ashenvale quests now)
Go all the way to the north of wetlands, on the border of the bridge into arathi.
Pick up and complete every quest from the dark iron dwarf quest hub, these are no longer elite mobs. 
After completing all those quests in the area, they give 2 follow-ups, one for a dungeon which you can skip and “plea to the alliance” which you can turn in at arathi highlands, just take the arathi quest.
Pick up mackerel’s moonshine by jumping from the broken bridge (the one west of the path into arathi) while in ghost wolf.
Hearth back to menethil
Fly to arathi, turn in the 2 quests at refuge point, and accept “Northfold Manor”
Do as much of “Northfold Manor” as possible before running over to southshore when you have about 4 minutes left on “mackreel’s moonshine” quest timer.
*Set Hearth* in southshore and turn-in/pickup all the quests.
Should be close to 32 at this point, start doing the southshore quests, starting with the murlocs on the beach, until at least 7.2k away from 32, if not 32 already.
Travel back to exodar for the air elemental quest, gives about 7.2k xp. Obtain the totem, hit 32, train new 32 skills, then astral recall back to southshore.
