All the quests we’re completing in STV for now can be broken up into 4 mini-circuits, thanks to Astral Recall/hearthstone use. The boot upgrade from doing the whole crocolisk skin line is massive at this point and has 3 steps, which is the main reason we break it up like this.
Circuit 1: Complete the initial rebel camp quests “The second rebellion” and “Bad medicine.”\\If you’re able to escort Thorsen do “Jungle secrets” and “Bookie Herod” at the same time too.\\From the nesingwary camp, complete the first 2 Panther quests, and all 4 tiger quests from their respective chains. Pick up the Krazek’s cookery and then run all the way south to Booty Bay, pick up every available quest, and *set hearth*.
Circuit 2: Fly back up to the rebel camp then head southwest to do all the following:\\Young crocolisk skins/First raptor chain quest/Singing Blue shards/All the troll quests for ears and tablets/The Haunted Isle. *note* the troll quests are skippable if fine on xp and they seem too dangerous for you, they are not amazing quests, you do lose some follow-up quests later though.
Do “The stone of the Tides” and the troll tablet in the water over there last, then Recall back to booty bay from the island and turn in everything/accept followups.
Circuit 3: Fly back up to rebel camp and turn in/accept next quests there and at the nesingwary camp. Do all the following: snapjaw croc skins/2nd raptor chain quest/Hostile takeover/the 2 new kurzen quests inside the cave. Do the cave last, then Recall back to booty bay and repeat the process from before with mass turns/new quests at all camps.
Circuit 4: Do “Water Elementals” and the final step in the crocolisk skin line, “Excelsior.” When both done, hearth back to Booty Bay, turn them in and then take the boat over to Ratchet and fly to Theramore.
