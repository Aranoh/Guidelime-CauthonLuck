[N56-58 Felwod&Winterspring]
Turn in “Cleansed Water returns to Felwood,” and accept “Dousing the flames of Protection,” “To Winterspring,” and “Felbound Ancients.” You may already have some of these quests from earlier in felwood.
Look around for a *songflower* buff, or re-grind out some shards/salves while down here if you’re out of salves.
Fly to Northern Felwood.
Turn in “Speak to Nafien,” accept “Deadwood of the North.”
Do it and turn it in, accept “Speak to Salfa”
Run through the timbermaw cave into Winterspring.
Turn in “Speak to Salfa,” accept “Winterfall activity.”
Start grinding the winterfall mobs for that quest until the *quest starter* item “empty firewater flask” drops.
Turn “Winterfall firewater” and “It’s a secret to everybody” into Donova Snowden.
Accept “Falling to Corruption” and “Strange Sources.”
Finish “Moontouched Feathers” while going east to Everlook. 
*Set Hearth* and accept every quest.
Fly back to north Felwood and clear out the deadwood area again while doing “Falling to Corruption.” You’ll probably have 2 *quest starter* totems by this point, we can turn them in for big XP a bit later when we get up to neutral timbermaw rep.
Fly from north Felwood to Darnassus.
Turn in “Moontouched Feathers,” and accept “Find Ranshalla.”
Turn in “un’goro soil” and do all the cloth turn-ins here if you haven’t already.
Go to the temple to collect water for “Felbound Ancients.”
Recall back to Everlook. 
Ride back west to turn in “Mystery Goo,” accept “Toxic Horrors.”
Finish “Threat of the Winterfall” by here and turn it in.
Run west through the tunnel again, remember to refresh *songflower* buff periodically when you have the chance.
Do “Toxic Horrors.”
Do “Dousing the flames of Protection” and look for the “Blood Red Key” *quest starter* that drops from the mobs down in this area. Turn it in for 8.1k xp, but don’t do the escort follow-up, takes too long. When done with both of these recall back to everlook.
Do “Are we there Yeti?” then ride west and turn in “Toxic Horrors” and accept “Winterfall Runners.”
If you haven’t seen the runners recently or know their position (the patrol of 3) then just go into the northern felwood furbolg camp and kill the single runner there.
Turn in “Winterfall Runners,” accept “High chief Winterfall” and recall/hearth to everlook.
Do “Ursius the Shardtooth” and “Chillwind Horns,” horns can be finished later if you don’t get enough of them right now.
Turn in “To Winterspring” and pick up all the quests from this area that follow, the “Enraged Wildkin” questline is huge xp for not much effort.
Finish “Winterfall Activity”
Finish “High chief Winterfall,” and click his *quest starter* “crudely written log”
Turn in “Are we there Yeti” “Chillwind Horns,” and “Ursius” and accept all the new quests.
Ride all the way to the west of the zone and turn in High chief winterfall/the final Piece/Winterfall Activity, and accept “Words of the high chief.”
Run west through the timbermaw tunnel, you should be at neutral reputation with timbermaw now so you can turn in both of the *quest starter* totems for 16.5k xp. If you’re not quite at neutral rep yet, grind it out here then turn those totems in.
Fly from north Felwood down to south Felwood.
Turn in “Words of the High Chief” to get a huge trinket reward, and turn in all other quests at Emerald Sanctuary, but do not do any of the followup quests. Recall/hearth/fly back to Everlook.
Do all the quests to the south of Everlook now. *note* “Are we there yeti” part2 is optional, if other people are there, or you clear out all the matriarch/patriarchs and have gotten 0 pristine yeti horns, skip it. SKIP GUARDIANS OF THE ALTAR once you turn in “Find Ranshalla,” it’s a super long escort that is not worth the time.
After finishing all the quests down south, Brumeran/chillwind horns/are we there yeti part 2/Strange Sources/Luck be with you/Enraged wildkin line, recall back to everlook and turn everything in. 
Ride north to do “Shy-Rotam” and turn it in at Everlook, this quest is no longer elite and worth 16k+ xp so it’s worth the effort now.
Ride west and do “Troubled spirits of Kel’Theril” Ride all the way to the west of the zone and turn in Strange Sources.
Run west through the tunnel, if you’re somehow all the way up to friendly rep with timbermaw at this point, you can turn in some runecloth for xp here, not worth the effort to grind out the rep if you’re far away though.
Refresh *songflower* buff in northern Felwood before leaving, then fly to Auberdine
Boat over to Wetlands.
Fly Iron Forge for class skills.
*optional* Do the cloth turn-ins for both gnomes/dwarves, some people may prefer to save these for TBC launch to get extra xp towards 61.
Turn in the 2nd “a little slime goes a long way” quest from un’goro.
Turn in “The smoldering ruins of Thaurissan” and then fly to Chillwind Point.
