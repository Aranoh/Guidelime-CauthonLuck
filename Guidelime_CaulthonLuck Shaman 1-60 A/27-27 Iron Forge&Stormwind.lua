[N27-27 Iron Forge&Stormwind]
Swim way out along the coast to the west of town until reaching an area with water that counts as being in Dun Morogh. Drown here to death warp to the middle of Dun Morogh and then run up into Iron Forge. Here is the general spot on the map you need to swim. You can also just do the normal run down through loch modan if you want, but that’s slower.
use: /way dun morogh 17 16
Should have a couple quests to turn-in here in Iron Forge, keep turning in and accepting the next step for Sully’s letter, the other quest can skip the follow-ups. 
Train all the weapon skills from weapon master here in Iron Forge, mostly just need 1h axe, but you never know, and should have extra money to get them all. Use the shield from the druid escort quest + 1h axe now, buy a vendor shield for the time being if you forgot to save it.
Train new shaman skills/upgrade first aid if you need it.
*Don’t forget to grab the flight paths in IF/SW!*
Take deeprun tram over to stormwind after getting the IF flight path, check the engineer supplies npc for a bronze tube right by the tram.
Get off tram in stormwind, check engineer supply npc for a bronze tube here on this side too if you still need one.
Get flight path in SW, turn in your stormwind quest/accept follow-up for dust devils in westfall.
Leave SW and run south towards the west side of Duskwood, leveling up your 1h axe on the low level mobs on the way.
