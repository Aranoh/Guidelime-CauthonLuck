[N52-53 Felwood]
Run to Emerald Sanctuary, grab flightpath and all quests.
*note* The *songflower* serenade buff is incredibly strong for the early 50s due to it being crit rating instead of flat 5% crit now, so unlocking and maintaining good uptime on this buff is high priority for my route. “Cleansing Felwood” is the unlock quest.
Kill some mobs near the road for “The forces of jaedenar” as you head north. We will finish it later, but you have to wait on respawns or go deep into caves to finish it all at once so it’s better to do just a bit of it now.
Do “Verifying the corruption” while riding northeast towards “Cleansing Felwood.”
Do “Cleansing Felwood”
Go to the ally hub south of Felpaw village for the flightpath and fly back to Emerald Sanctuary. 
Turn everything in/accept follow-ups. 
Grind out some shards once you get the cenarion beacon by Picking up and doing “Timbermaw Ally” and turning it in
Turn in “Salve via Hunting” and look around for a *songflower* buff on the south end of felwood while grinding.
Do “The corruption of the Jadefire.”
Turn it in and accept “Further Corruption”
Ride north killing cursed and tainted slimes to fill the jars for “A little slime goes a long way.”
Finish “The forces of Jaedenar”
Return to Emerald Sanctuary and turn everything in/take followups. 
Do “Collection of the corrupt Water”
Continue north and do “Further Corruption”
Get the *quest starter* item from Xavaric and start/do “Flute of Xavaric”
Go to the northern flight path and fly back down to the Emerald Sanctuary.
Turn in all quests and take the follow-ups. 
Turn in more shards to get additional salves.
Refresh *songflower* buff, then fly to Darnassus.
Turn in all quests and accept the follow-ups, make sure to pick up “March of the Silithid.”
Hearth back to Iron Forge.
Train class skills and turn in “A little slime goes a long way” and take the followup which is the same quest, but for slimes in un’goro.
Pick up “The smoldering ruins of Thaurissan,” remember to wait for the RP and talk to the npc again in a moment.
