[N12-16 Bloodmyst Isle]
Pick up the quests at the quest hub over the bridge in bloodmyst, use “the kessel run” mount to go north quicker to Blood Watch. You can abandon the quest once it dismounts you, we will finish it for real later on.
Pick up all the quests you can in town, and *set hearth*. 
Turn in the first step of the “Beds Bandages and Beyond” quest chain that leads you back to exodar, but don’t take the flight path yet. The xp from this turn-in should get you 12, if not 12 yet, grind a few mobs around town to get there.
Do the level 15 quest “Blood Watch” just northwest of town. The quest mobs are 13/14 so buy some lvl 5 food/drink and pull safely, one at a time, till you kill 10 of them. 1h Weapon reward is really good so it’s worth doing now, take the 8.2dps green 1h mace.
Pick up first aid if you haven’t already gotten it in order to skill it up during SW island escort quest we’ll be doing shortly.
Fly to exodar then travel southwest to the island. 
Start the escort quest “A cry for help,” and open the quest pack you got for the shaman class quest, *do not click* the orb until done with the 2 quests on this island, it is an instant non-channel teleport back to the fire elemental across the zone.
Turn in “A cry for help” at the dock to the south, then do the shaman class quest and use the orb to teleport back to the fire elemental once it’s done. *note* technically you can do the shaman class quest during the escort, but it’s risky as dying or failing the shaman quest will cause you to have to run a long ways to pick it up again. You can watch the video of my run on twitch or youtube if you’d like to see how. 
Wait for the long (20-30 second) shaman class quest RP after turn-in then take the next step in the chain.
Head northwest to re-start the elekk quest “The Kessel Run.”
Ride south, warning all 3 people required for the quest, turning in the next shaman class quest step at Azure Watch, and turning in any remaining quests in those areas.
*note* don’t run over any indoor terrain or water or the mount will despawn
Ride west into exodar to turn in the delivery quest, shaman quest, and to train class skills. Do not dismount, the temporary elekk can be used through all of exodar. 
Ride out of exodar, turn in the quest “Coming of Age,” and accept “Elekks are serious business, then take the flightpath back up to Blood Watch, turning in the final steps of the delivery quest as you go.
If level 13 after landing and turning in the delivery quest, pick up “know thine enemy,” just do it later if not 13 yet.
Run south, picking up a quest mushroom in the river and mining the quest crystal on the way, then turn in all the elekk quests. Should have a few min of leeway before the 15 minute timer expires. 
Do all quests on the southeast part of the zone by this quest hub now and turn them in, pick up any of the 4 quest mushrooms for “Mac’aree Mushroom Menagerie” as you go.
Head west across the river to do “Catch and Release.”
Kill the named murloc that wanders this area for a *quest starter* necklace.
Finish collecting all the mushrooms in this area and do “Know thine enemy.”
Once finished, return to Blood Watch and turn all in everything/grab new quests.
Prioritize blood elf line first, grab the missive just northwest of town for “Intercepting the Message”
Turn it in then progress the quest line to the “Audience with the Prophet,” fly back and turn that in/accept “Truth or Fiction” + train lvl 14 class skills and hearth back to Bloodwatch.
Turn in “Truth or Fiction” and accept “I shoot magic into darkness.”
Finish the treant bark quest south of town, there are tons of them around the red crystal formations.
Go northeast for “The missing survey team” then kill naga for “Salvaging the Data.”
Do “I shoot magic into darkness” and kill as many lashers as possible west of the road to start getting some of the quest drops for “Constrictor Vines” as you travel to and from that quest.
Do “The second sample” as you run back to Bloodwatch.
Turn everything in/accept new quests. It’s best to just always pick up every available quest at these quest hubs even if we don’t finish everything till later, it’s faster overall to do that and abandon unwanted quests later, than to meticulously pick up the exact number of quests we’re about to do.
When turning in “Irradiated crystal shards,” I prefer the +5 stamina buff, it’s pretty impactful at lower levels.
Should be at least 15 by this point, buy a bunch of the level 15 food and water and upgrade your bags with any remaining money.
Do the cryo core quest for the 2h staff upgrade, also attempt to complete the quest line for Galen at same time in the area. If you don’t get the necklace drop for Galen’s quest by the time you’re done with all the blood elves/lasher quest item collection, just save that quest for later when you come back here at 20.
Finish the “Constricting Vines”, skip bear meat unless forced to kill a few and meat drops, the drop rate is really random and the bears are buff af. Turn everything in at town/take follow-ups.
Finish the last 2 quests here for now, “Culling the Flutterers” for belt upgrade, and “Matis the Cruel” in the same general area for the leather leg upgrade.
Turn in any excess Irradiated crystal shards for the 5 stamina buff items. 
Fly exodar and set hearth then train 16 class skills and walk out to the boat to darkshore via the west entrance. 
Turn in “Newfound Allies,” accept “The Way to Auberdine,” and skill up first aid while waiting/riding the boat.
Now that we have Rockbiter rank 3, switch over to the 2hand staff you got from the Cryo Core quest and use that weapon + Rockbiter until level 20.
