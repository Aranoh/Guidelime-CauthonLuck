[N41-42 Arathi Highland&Alterac Mountains]
Head over to arathi and complete the final couple quests we have for this area.
Complete the “sunken treasure” line down at the cove.
Complete “Attack on the tower.” Turn it in and accept “Malin’s Request”
Recall to Southshore and head up north into Alterac Mountains for “Crushridge Warmongers.”
Complete “Crushridge Warmongers,” and “The Perenolde Tiara” 
Can grind out the rest of the way to 42 on the warmongers in this area, there are a couple dozen spawns of them and they are super squishy, just avoid their enrage by not killing them next to each other. Most importantly they drop a blue axe called the “Sickle Axe” that can be used for almost the rest of the leveling process if playing SSF. They can also drop 2 green axes that are upgrades in the main hand to the white vendor axe we are using right now. 
If not interested in any of the weapon drops here due to buying weapons ahead of time, you can just progress to Dustwallow part 2 now after completing the quest, if playing SSF, it’s probably worth continuing to kill these further into 42 if you haven’t yet gotten one of their numerous weapon drop upgrades.
Recall back to southshore to turn the quest in and then fly to Stormwind.
Turn in quests here, train class skills, and then take the teleport back to Dustwallow from the guy at the base of the mage tower, due to your active quest from dustwallow “return to jaina.” Then turn the quest in, the teleport stops working at higher levels.
