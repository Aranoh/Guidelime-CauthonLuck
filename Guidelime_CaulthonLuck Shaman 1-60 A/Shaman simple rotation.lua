[NShaman simple rotation]
The exact spells you use change frequently while leveling, so it’s difficult to be specific. At earlier levels, the newest rank of shocks and weapon enchants tend to be much better than your other options, so you usually prioritize the newest ranks of abilities until later levels. A very general overview of the rotation would be:
1-40 You're kind of a melee warlock, most of the damage is done through slow ticking spells and auto attacks. Most fights will go - flame shock to pull, make sure lightning shield is up, drop searing totem, then auto attack the mob down to conserve mana, using whatever your highest damage direct shock is when shamanistic focus procs. 
41+ You're now a burst damage class, always dual wield 1h weapons, the slower the better. Stormstrike early in the fight, keep lightning shield up, use almost exclusively earth shock for damage since it gets 20% more damage from stormstrike and your shamanistic focus procs a ton with dual wield/double windfury. You'll almost be able to just earth shock on cooldown with the reduced mana cost shocks.
For Totem usage, at earlier levels you can freely drop searing totem/mana spring totem anytime as long as you’re fighting for 8+ seconds or so in the same general area. Stoneskin totem is decent at early-mid levels when fighting fast attacking or dual wield mobs. Use stoneclaw totem immediately at all levels as soon as you’re fighting more than 1 mob at once. Strength of earth totem is better at later levels when you get the mental quickness talent.
At 41+ you usually will be killing mobs too quickly to bother with totems, if you’re just running from mob to mob chain killing. If you’re in an area where you can set up your totems and pull a bunch of mobs into them one at a time, it’s fine to drop searing/mana spring/grace of air/strength of earth as long as you’re not relocating too quickly. Killing 2-3 mobs in the same area make searing/mana spring still worth it, even with very fast kill speeds. With the earth/air totems you need more like 4-5 mobs of value to make them worth the mana cost when things are dying in 5 seconds or less most of the time.
