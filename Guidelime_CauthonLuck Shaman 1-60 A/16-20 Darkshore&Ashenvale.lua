[N16-20 Darkshore&Ashenvale]
Turn in “The Way to Auberdine,” and pick up every available quest around the town, except for the buzzbox questline and “the family and the fishing pole.” You can abandon some of the Blood Watch quests to make room in the quest log if you like, we’ll be finishing almost all of them later, but you can just pick them up again at Bloodwatch.
Do the whole “Bashal’Aran” chain to the northeast of town first, up till the final part which sends you way south. Avoid killing the level 10 grells here, if possible, they are grey, but the vast majority of the mobs are 11+ and still give exp.
Scout the red crystal along the eastern mountain on the way south.
Continue south to Ameth’Aran, we complete 4 quests here in the ghost area.
Grind the south side for this area for higher level non-grey mobs for “Tools of the Highborne,” and complete “Bashal’Aran” and “For love eternal.”
Pick up and do the “The fall of Ameth’Aran” from the quest-giver on the road to the west while finishing all the quests here, turn it in and head northwest when all are done.
Capture a rabid thistle bear 
Get the first sea creature part for the “Washed Ashore” chain.
Scout the furbolg camp on way back to town for “How big a Threat?”
Mass turn in/accept every new quest, remember to get moonwell water now in town for the next step of red crystal chain “As water cascades.”
Loot the sea creature off the docks for the 2nd step in “Washed Ashore” and turn it in. This unlocks all the *quest starter* sea creatures on the shore throughout the zone.
Clear blackwood camp to the south of town for the next step of “How big a threat?”
Start working on 20 rabid thistle bear kills while grinding south.
Pick up the 2 *quest starter* sea creatures.
Do the Murkdeep event, try to heal between waves to avoid being over-run, best to not leave totems up or new waves of murlocs will agro them.
Grind bears to the east and northeast until done with 20 kills. and 
Head north to cleanse the red crystal for “As water cascades,” and take the followup.
Return to town and mass turn in quests/accept new quests again.
Head northeast from town, turn in the final step of “Bashal’Aran” we did earlier.
Pop a +5 stamina buff from the Draenei area if you have one, the next 5 quests or so are more dangerous than most so be cautious. 
Kill the Den mother, kite her away from cubs while they attack a stoneclaw totem.
Do “Cave mushrooms”
Do the “Tower of althalaxx” scroll quest, try to interrupt curse of mending that these mobs cast, it’s an annoying 3m debuff.
Pick up “Gyromast’s Retrieval” and start collecting the keys.
Collect 5 Moonstalker pelts, go for sires when possible, they are much easier than the matriarchs/cubs. Use stoneclaw totem when fighting the duo pulls.
*note* above 2 quests are skippable if you feel they are too dangerous/not worth the time, they are pretty borderline worth it.
Turn in “Gyromast’s Retrieval” then escort and kill first mate for the followup, he is no longer elite.
Collect Cliffspring river sample.
Do “Fruit of the sea” for 6 crab chunks while traveling south along the shore
Grab the *quest starter* creatures along the shore while heading south.
Do “Deep ocean, vast sea.”
Mass turn in quests at town again and grab new quests.
Travel way south for “onu” and grab his quest “The master’s glaive.”
Finish that quest chain and then escort the dryad out of there for “thereylune’s escape.”
Grab the 4 sea creature *quest starter* items by all the murlocs starting with the southern one and working north. Beware of murloc adds, pull 1 at a time and slow them.
Turn in “the absent minded prospector” but skip the escort, this quest is notoriously bugged with an incorrect amount of mob spawns that kill the escort.
Turn in “A lost master,” can use the stealth cloak to get to him without fighting anything.
Do “escape by stealth,” force is fine too if you want to gamble, it’s more xp for a longer escort that has some risk of death.
Turn in onu scrying quest, skip follow up.
Start the druid escort quest “The sleeper has awakened,” and grab the horn from the chest right next to him (required.)
Do “one shot one kill” on the way south.
Stay off the roads and walk the druid down into ashenvale, I just stay to the west of the road while escorting him, the mobs that attack the druid won’t spawn if you’re away from the road a ways. Keep the shield reward from the druid escort turn-in for later if playing solo self-found.
Turn in all completed quests between Maestra’s post and Astranaar.
Grab the flightpath from astranar, fly back to auberdine to turn in all quests.
Boat over to Menethil harbor for the murloc quest chain that gives icicle staff, starts with “claws from the deep”. 
Kill the murlocs/gobbler and turn it in for the next step in the chain.
Finish the remaining steps to loot items by the murloc huts. There are high level murlocs around by the final hut, but you don’t have to fight them, you can just drop a taunt totem and pick up the quest item instantly/run away. Don’t worry about deaths, the graveyard is literally right next to these quests, and the quest reward is great.
After turning in the final step of the chain, take the “Icicle Rod” 2h staff, this will be our main weapon from now until 27.
