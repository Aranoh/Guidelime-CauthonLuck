[N58-60 Western & Eastern Plaguelands]
*note* Going directly to outlands at 58 is a good idea in order to do the first 5 or 6 easy quests and get the outland quest rewards. Unless you are extremely well-geared, it will be faster overall to return to Azeroth for the rest of 58-60 and then continue on to outlands. Your progress in outlands will slow to a crawl if you’re an undergeared lvl 58 melee class trying to kill Lvl 60-62 mobs for quests after the first handful of easy quests. See below for fastest way to gear up with outlands equipment from quests following the plaguelands section.
*Check out 58-60 Mail Outlands Gearing Guide* also helps if questing is not your main goal after hitting 58+ to kickstart your gear for dungeon spamming
Turn in all quests when landing and accept all quests from chillwind point.
If out of Alterac Manna Biscuits or running low, take this time to run down to the AV area and restock.
Turn in “Good Luck Charm”
Finish the followup, “Two halves become one.”
Do “Target: Dalson’s Tears” and take “Return to Chillwind Camp”
Click the *quest starter* journal in the barn in this same field, then kill the wandering skeleton for the outhouse key. *note* the next step involving the outhouse sometimes bugs out and can’t be completed. If this is the case, it won’t be fixed until a server restart, or possibly if you can get onto a different layer.
Click on the outhouse to spawn Farmer Dalson and get the cabinet key
Go upstairs to complete “Locked away”
Do “Return to chillwind camp”
Do the Final 2 cauldron quests and the 2 “the wildlife suffers too” quests, you may have to kill spiders to force wolf spawns. Grab “Glyphed Oaken Branch.” to turn in later in darnassus if you want to take the time to take a shattrath portal there later.
After killing the cauldron lord for the final part of that chain, run east into EPL, we’ll turn it in at chillwind camp later. 
Pick up the 3 mega grind quests from tyrion, “Demon Dogs” “Carrion Grubbage” “Blood tinged skies”
Kill the mobs for these quests anytime you can while progressing through the rest of eastern plaguelands.
Turn in sister pamela/accept pamela’s doll
Do “Pamela’s Doll,” turn it in, and accept the followups
Grind your way over to light’s hope chapel, turn in all completed quests here, then make sure to pick up “Defenders of Darrowshire,” “Zaeldarr the Outcast” and “The Restless Souls.” *Set hearth* here
Do a large circuit to the northwest, finishing all the grind quests from tyrion, “Defenders of Darrowshire,” and turning in ““Troubled spirits of Kel’Theril” (skip followup)
Do “A plague upon thee.”
Turn in “The Restless Souls,” can skip the dungeon followup.
Can accept and do “Augustus’ receipt book” while up here too.
Recall back to Light’s hope chapel and turn in “Defenders of Darrowshire”
Fly back to chillwind point and turn everything in/take followups.
Turn in “auntie marlene” and accept “a strange historian”
Turn in “a strange historian” at the grave outside of that house.
Turn in the final part of “a strange historian” to chromie and accept all her quests
We have a ton of quests to do in andorhal now, complete “A matter of time,” “All along the watchtowers” and “The annals of Darrowshire.”
Turn in “A matter of time” and “The annals of Darrowshire” and take the followups. 
Do and then turn in “counting out time.”
Head north and do the entire “Unfinished business” quest chain while finishing other quests in northern WPL.
Unleash the termites for “a plague upon thee part 2” while up in this area and take the followup.
Do “The mark of the lightbringer” *warning* there is sometimes a lvl 63 elite rare spawn in this area. If he’s up, you can try to bypass him by kiting him away and using stonclaw totem while finishing the quest, or by running to the top of the tower, dying, then ankh rez yourself when he’s out of range. It’s possible that due to his position by other mobs, this may be too time consuming/frustrating to complete so you can skip the quest if you like. There are plenty of other quests in the plaguelands to finish 60 without doing this chain.
Turn in the 3 grind quests to tyrion, most likely you are 60 or close to 60 at this point. If the quests you have to turn in back at chillwind camp will give you 60, just recall to light’s hope and then fly back there. 
If still a ways off from 60, you can continue Tyrion’s quest chain + the next few steps, do “Zaeldarr the Outcast” and “Hameya’s Plea” from the same area, do the escort quest that follows up “mark of the lightbringer,” and then any remaining quests in EPL from Light’s Hope Chapel until 60.
