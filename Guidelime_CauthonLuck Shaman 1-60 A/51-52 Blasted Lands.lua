[N51-52 Blasted Lands]
Fly to nethergarde keep and pick up “Petty Squabbles”
Turn in “Thadius Grimshade,” you can skip the follow-up unless you plan to run ZF.
Run to the fallen hero of the horde on the border to swamp of sorrows and progress the quest line as far as possible via his chat bubbles. Don’t try to complete “the stones that bind us” yet, there are lvl 57 mobs for that quest.
Pick up the quests from the bloodmage camp east of Dreadmaul Hold.
I plan to just grind out “The Decisive Striker” and “Snickerfang Jowls,” but may do 1 or 2 more depending on drop rng while grinding the area. If I get to this zone and a bunch of people are already killing these mobs, I’m just skipping all of these quests. 
If you want to complete them all you’ll need the following:
*14 Gizzard from Bird*
*11 Brain from Basilisk*
*6 Lung from Boar*
*6 Pincer from Scorpid*
*5 Jowl from Hyena*
If you happen to get any Draenethyst Fragments  while doing these quests, turn them in to Kum’isha the collector for xp/items before leaving Blasted Lands. 
Fly to Booty Bay and turn in remaining quests here. If you have to wait for the boat over to ratchet, you can waterwalk over to the island and do “The Monogrammed Sash,” skip the followup. 
Boat over to Ratchet, can pick up the stone circle and the quest for volcanic activity now if you want, can also just get them later right before we go down to un’goro.
Fly up to Forest Song in east Ashenvale.
