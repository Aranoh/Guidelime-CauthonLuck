[N47-48 Tanaris]
Turn in Hippogryph Egg to the egg-o-matic and turn in the follow up quest right next to there for xp. *Set hearth*.
*optional* Shaman skills at 48 are very strong, new rank of both earth shock and lightning shield so it’s a huge boost to damage. If you’re a bit ahead on xp and about to hit 48, or already 48, you can go train class skills in stormwind + turn in any stormwind quests and then recall back to Gadgetzan if you still have most of the zone left to do.
Turn in “the borrower” and accept “The super snapper FX”
Pick up and Do “Noxious Lair Investigation” 
Recall/turn in and accept “The scrimshank redemption” 
Pick up all other non-dungeon quests from Gadgetzan
Ride east and turn in “screecher spirits”
Pick up all other quests from Steamwheedle Port. 
Do “Southsea Shakedown”
Do “Wanted: Andre Firebeard”
Do “Stoley’s Shipment,” all of these quests are in the same pirate cove area.
Look for the *quest starter* item “Ship Schedule” from the pirate footlockers for some bonus xp. If it hasn’t dropped by the time you’re done with the quests, you can keep grinding for it if you want, can also get the “save oox” *quest starter* item here potentially too.
You may also want to keep an eye out for the “captain’s key,” the chest that key opens and the footlockers have a chance of dropping a blue 1h mace - writ’s third leg.
Do “The scrimshank redemption.”
Turn in “the sunken temple,” accept “the stone circle” and “ghaz’ridian.”
Work on both “the dunemaul compound” and “ghaz’ridian” at the same time, turn in “gahz'ridian” when finished.
Do “Thistleshrub Valley” and “The thirsty Goblin”
If you’ve gotten the “find oox” zone drop for tanaris and you can find tooga, you can do both escorts at the same time, otherwise just skip “tooga’s quest,” since it takes so long.
Recall and turn in all quests/take follow-ups from gadgetzan
Do the same at Steamwheedle port
Should be at least 48 by now, probably halfway in. If not 48, grind the pirate area for a bit to hit 48 and have an additional chance at the *quest starter*s/blue mace.
