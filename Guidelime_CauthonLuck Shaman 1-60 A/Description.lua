[NDescription]
This is the route I’ll be using myself on pre-patch/TBC launch. It’s not intended to be sold or to mimic a super detailed Joana/Rxp-style guide. Often multiple steps are bunched together for brevity, but the guide can be combined with my twitch vods or youtube videos from this path for more detail at https://www.twitch.tv/cauthonluck
Be sure to pick up the “Questie” WoW addon to show quest objectives on the map.
If you wish to copy some of the content and create a route more specific to a different class, go right ahead. For any questions/comments, requests of things to be added to the guide, or just general leveling discussion, you can join my WoW speedrunning discord at https://discord.gg/H5cQBXK
If you enjoyed the guide and would like to help support similar content creation in the future, you can toss me your twitch prime next time it’s off cooldown at https://www.twitch.tv/cauthonluck - all subs greatly appreciated!
This Guidelime is setup by Arano, u can find me on CauthonLuck's discord!
