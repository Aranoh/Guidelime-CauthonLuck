[N53-54 Burning Steppes]
Fly to Burning Steppes
Pick up “Extinguish the Firegut” and “Dragonkin Menace”
Pick up “Broodling Essence” and “Tablet of the seven” at the other quest camp to the north of zone.
Grind your way east, working on “Dragonkin Menace” and “Broodling Essence” together. *note* the quests we’re doing right now are extremely grindy, taking at least 60-70 mob kills to complete, be extra cautious to avoid dying so you maintain your *songflower* buff for all this grinding.
Accept and then turn in “A taste of flame” you should already have the black dragonflight molt from doing Searing Gorge, if not you’ll have to re-kill a dragon to get it.
Finish “Extinguish the Firegut,” “Dragonkin Menace,” and “Broodling Essence.”
Turn in “Extinguish the Firegut” and “Dragonkin Menace” back at Morgan’s Vigil and accept the follow-ups. 
Taking a detour here to complete multiple steps of the onyxia attunement chain that leads from “Dragonkin Menace,” gives a ton of xp just for a bit of travel.
Fly to Lakeshire to turn in next step of the chain and *Set Hearth* 
Fly to Stormwind to turn in the next couple steps of the chain, and also to turn in the next couple steps of “Better Late than Never” chain from plaguelands.
Hearth/Recall back to Lakeshire for another turn-in from onyxia chain
Fly to Burning steppes again for the final steps in the chain prior to it becoming a dungeon quest.
Pick up the Tablet of the seven quest item, and the items on the ground for “The smoldering ruins of Thaurissan”
Run to the northern camp to turn in “Tablet of the Seven,” “Broodling Essence,” and to talk to Ragged John for the onyxia chain. 
Accept “Felnok Steelspring,” the followup to Broodling Essence.
Do “Gor’tesh the Brutelord”
Turn that quest and the onyxia chain quest in back at Morgan’s Vigil.
Accept and do “Ogre head on a stick = Party.”
Turn it in and Fly to Booty Bay and boat to Ratchet.
Pick up the stone circle and “Volcanic Activity,” if you haven’t already done so, and *Set Hearth* in Ratchet. (May want to bank excess cloth and such now too)
Do “Seeking Spiritual Aid” and take the followup “Cleansed Water Returns to Felwood”
*optional* As a shaman, due to astral recall, we can actually take a detour here to turn in the above quest and refresh *songflower* buff at this point. It’s only a 4 minute flight from ratchet to felwood, and there’s probably already a pre-cleansed *songflower* ready from when we were there earlier. If you trust yourself to stay alive for the *songflower* duration while questing in un’goro, it’s worth it - if you die quickly with the buff it’s not worth it, so gamble away if you’re feeling brave and then recall back to Ratchet.
Fly to Tanaris and turn in all completed quests, make sure to pick up “Super Sticky” and “Bungle in the Jungle” while here.
