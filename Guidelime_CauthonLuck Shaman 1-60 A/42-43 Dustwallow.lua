[N42-43 Dustwallow]
Fly down to Mudsprocket and *Set Hearth*
Accept every quest here, then run up to Tabetha’s Hut to the north and get every quest from here and the crash site next to it.
Complete every single quest you’ve obtained for the southern half of Dustwallow here, the order barely matters as it’s more of a “modern” style quest hub that has you do a few quests in one place/turn them in, then move on to the next location. Can use hearth/recall to save a bit of travel time
Keep an eye out for a forsaken mob at direhorn post, she drops a *quest starter* item
After all quests from the south of the zone and the followups are completed/turned in, which should net a full level for this section, Fly up to Ratchet and *Set Hearth* 
Should have enough money to buy mount at this point if you didn’t already get it at 30 with money from a different character. Travel to Exodar to buy mount if you need it, train class skills if needed, then recall back to Ratchet.
Boat over to Booty Bay.
