Accept/turn in “You Survived,” kill 2 mobs on the way over since mana will regen. Delete Hearthstone for extra bag space, we won’t use it till close to lvl 10.
Grab the followup to “You Survived, “Replenishing the Healing Crystals.”
Grab volatile mutations quest and finish both quests for moth crystals/mutations.
Turn in both, grab the 2 flower quest followups “What must be done”,“Botanical Legwork”
*note* these are good quests to skip if starting area is super crowded, they only lead to 1 other small quest, the next quests are more important.
Run into the town area to vendor/pick up new quests.
While there, grab rockbiter and a staff from weapon vendor. Equip staff/cast Rockbiter then grind northwest to the 2 flower quests.
Finish the 2 flower quests and heal a wounded draenei survivor with your Gift of the Naaru for “Rescue the Survivors.” Turn those 3 quests in to hit 4 and train Earthshock.
Helps to make a simple shock +startattack macro here
Cleanse the lake crystal to the south while heading down to the moonkin area for those 2 quests “Inoculation” and “Spare Parts.”
Do the 2 moonkin quests then deathwarp (intentionally die by pulling multiple mobs and/or standing in fire) to skip the long walk back to town.
Resurrect at the spirit healer then do the shaman class quest for earth totem.
Grind back towards town, turn in all quests, clear bags at the vendors and accept all follow-up quests.
Run southwest and turn in “The missing scout,” and then complete the rest of that quest chain dealing with the Blood Elves down in that area.
After killing Surveyor Candress for the last quest in the chain, click the *quest starter* item she drops. 
Deathwarp again via the blood elves/fire and turn in all quests back at town.
Use the staff rewarded from these quests, shaman don’t need lvl 6 class skills yet, can wait for 8 to train.
