Do “Freedom for all Creatures,” Helps to clear out the area before accepting quest.
Do the followup “Doling Justice”
Turn it in and grab the final step, which is way up in Darnassus, we’ll turn it in later.
Ride west to the dock and either take the boat over to feathermoon stronghold if it’s there, or just waterwalk over if not.
Pick up all quests here and *set hearth* 
Start with “The ruins of Solarsal” and turn it in/get next step. 
Do “Against the Hatecrest” and turn it in/accept “Against Lord Shalzaru.”
Waterwalk south to the naga cave and do “Against Lord Shalzaru” This is probably the best place to grind for quite some time if you need any additional xp or feel behind at this point, the naga casters die in just a couple seconds. I would grind out at least a few bars here to try to get the “rescue oox” drop for feralas, if you don’t have it already. 
Grind your way out of the cave and waterwalk east of feathermoon to do “The missing courier pt1.”
Recall feathermoon and turn both quests in/take follow-up. 
Boat or waterwalk east and do “Screecher Spirits”
Do “Mark of quality” and start the robot chicken escort in this area if you got the “resuce oox” *quest starter* to drop.
Do “The High Wilderness”
Pick up a Hippogryph Egg in the mountains to the south while finishing the above 2 quests, can get 6,000 exp for it later in Gadgetzan. 
Do “The woodpaw Gnolls” then click the *quest starter* that goes to your inventory for “Thalanaar Delivery,” will turn it in later.
Continue south to do “the writhing deep” and “freed from the hive”
Recall feathermoon and turn everything in/take followups. 
Fly up to Auberdine.
Take the boat over to teldrassil and run into Darnassus. 
Turn in every quest in this area and take follow-ups.
Recall feathermoon and waterwalk/boat over to the east again. (these last few quests are optional, not super great xp/hr and kind of take a while, can just skip to the last step if you’d like to head to tanaris at this point instead of doing them.)
Pick up and do “Zapped Giants” and “Fuel for the Zapping.”Turn them in and ride northeast to do “Improved Quality”
Keep grinding this area to get the *quest starter* “pristine yeti hide” at the same time.
Recall back to Feathermoon and turn those 2 quests in.
Take the flight path over to the Feralas/TN zone line to turn in “Thalanaar Delivery”
Fly to Gadgetzan
