[GA Alliance]
[N23-25 Ashenvale&Stonetalon]
In Auberdine, pick up the dungeon quest “Researching the Corruption,” the mobs are no longer elite for this quest, then fly to astranaar. 
    Turn in any quests you may still have at astranaar and maestra’s post, while picking up every available quest at those locations. 
    Do “Bathran’s Hair,” if you happen to get lucky and get the soul gem from the mobs while heading up to the “Bathran’s hair” area, turn it in, but don’t grind too long for it, super low drop rate. 
    Pick up the ancient statuette, then grind naga for the naga heads quest while heading north to pick up the statue. 
    Turn in statue/grab follow up for the ring to the north, then repeat the naga grind up towards the north to complete naga heads and the “Ruuzel” quest.
    Dip down into the area outside of BFD to kill the formerly elite mobs for “Researching the Corruption.”
    Turn in “Ruuzel” then grind down to do the Reane’s Cleansing quest.
    Complete the quest then head east for turn-ins. 
    Turn in every completed quest in the zone and take the follow ups. 
    Kill Dal bloodclaw, the named furbolg to the NW of town for “Culling the Threat.”
    Head east to pick up elune’s tear, and turn in a step of “Raene's Cleansing”
    Take the next step of “Raene's Cleansing,” but we won’t be completing it till much later.
    Return to town and turn in quests/get followups. 
    Go south of town to do “The Ruins of Stardust” and the next Water totem quest step.
    Take the talondeep path into Stonetalon.
    Pick up and do “Super reaper 6000” and “A gnome’s respite” in stonetalon.
    Do them both and turn-in. 
    Grab the 2 follow-ups after “A gnome’s respite,” can turn them in later in IF/Stormwind.
    Hearth back to Bloodmyst isle to finish the water totem quest. Don’t bother running all the way north to the alliance quest hub in StoneTalon, or doing the pridewing wyvern quest unless you want to level leatherworking or something, they take way too long and I don't go to desolace on this route. 
    Finish the water totem quest line, turn in the final step in exodar, and train level 24 skills. 
    Return to Darkshore and turn in “Researching the Corruption” (should get into 25 here) 
    Pick up level 25 food/drinks, *set hearth*, and turn in “The ruins of Stardust.” 
    Finish the last couple lower level Ashenvale quests in the area, “An Aggressive Defense,” and “Elemental Bracers.”
    Turn in “Elemental Bracers," skip the follow-up. 
    Run to the East Ashenvale alliance hub to turn in a couple delivery quests from astranaar and to pick up the flight path for later. 
    Hearth to Astranaar (or fly if heath is still down) and turn in “An Aggressive Defense.”
    Pick up “Fallen sky lake” for later if you haven’t already, we’ll do that and “Reane’s cleansing” at 30.
    Fly back to Auberdine and boat over to the Wetlands.
