Pick up all quests from BootyBay and *set hearth*.
Do “Scaring Shaky” and get a gorilla fang while doing so for the next quest.
Do “Stranglethorn Fever,” the mobs spawn 1 at a time now, easy to solo. 
Do “The Bloodsail Buccaneers” pt.4, if you don’t finish “Keep an Eye out” or “Up to snuff” while doing this, don’t worry, you can finish those during the final part.
Recall back to Booty Bay and turn everything in/accept follow ups. 
Do “Akiris by the bundle”
Head north to do Tethis for “Raptor Mastery”
Do Bhag’thera for “Panther Mastery”
Do “Troll Witchery” and “Skullsplitter Tusks” together
Go south for “Venture Company Mining”
Continue south for “Zanzil’s Secret”
Do “Voodoo Dues” in the same area
Run south along the eastern beach and kill Gorlash for “The captain’s chest” this can be a hard fight, set up totem castles and eat/drink to full beforehand and try to nuke him and kite as much as possible.
Loot the bottles along the beach as you continue down south to find the *quest starter* “message in a bottle”
Do the final part of “Bloodsail Buccaneers,” finishing up the eye/snuff quests now too if not done already.
Pick up the *quest starter* “cortello’s riddle” on the bottom of one of the three ships while finishing the bloodsail buccaneers.
Turn in “message in a bottle” on the island to the east, then do the follow-up to slay king mukla and release the captive.
Recall back to Booty Bay and turn everything in/accept follow-ups.
Fly up to the Rebel Camp.
Pick up “Colonel Kurzen” if you don’t have it already.
Turn in both raptor/panther quests at nesingwary camp and accept “big game hunter.”
Do “big game hunter”
Do “Colonel Kurzen”
Recall or hearth back to booty bay and fly to rebel camp again to turn kurzen in and accept “Mai’Zoth,” or just run out of the cave if neither are up.
Turn in “Big game hunter”
Do “cracking Maury’s foot” and “Mai’Zoth” at the same time/area. The quest item can take a while to drop, it doesn’t lead to anything further so you can just skip it if bad rng is driving you insane after a while.
Recall/Hearth and turn in maury’s foot, be sure to grab all available quests, then fly north to camp and turn in Mai’Zoth.
