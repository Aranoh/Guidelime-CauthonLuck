[N27-30 Duskwood]
Accept “Sven’s Revenge”
Run east and accept “Supplies from Darkshire”
Both of these are super long chains that we will eventually finish, continue traveling east while leveling the 1h axe on the easy mobs to get to Darkshire. 
Turn in and pick up every quest in town, continue to do this each time you return here. *Set Hearth*
If you have a bronze tube, can complete “look to the stars” here, the gnome right next to this quest giver can also sell them sometimes. Continue to look for bronze tubes from him and the stormwind npc that sells them as you travel around for duskwood quests if you don’t have one yet.
Turn in/Accept the quests from Blind Mary south of town. 
Do the first step of “the night’s watch” to kill skeletons down in this area. 
Kill the named ghoul in the church down here for mary’s looking glass to complete step 3 of look to the stars.
Head west along road and grab the item for “Sven’s Camp”
Turn in both quests to Sven and Abercrombie/take follow ups.
Run west into westfall for “The legend of stalvan” the other long quest chain we’re going to finish.
If you can find dust devils to kill on the way for the quest drop item, kill them, but don’t go out of your way to look for them, low xp from it being a lvl 21 quest.
Turn in Stalvan quest/get follow-up then hearth back to Darkshire.
Mass turn in/accept new quests.
Grind the skeletons right outside of Blind Mary’s Hut to work on 3 quests at once. You will complete part of “the night’s watch pt2” “the totem of infliction” and all of “Gather rot blossoms.”
Turn in the rot blossom quest and get all the follow-ups. 
Do first step of “Worgen in the Woods” to the north.
Travel back to the NW corner of the zone to turn in all the continuations of the Sven/Abercrombie quests.
Kill the skeletal fiends for the 2nd half of “The night watch” pt 2.
Kill random spiders in the area to complete that portion of “the totem of infliction”
After done with those two, head north to goldshire, save the other skeleton/ghoul quests for later when they can be combined with other quests.
Do the next step of “the legend of stalvan” and the lion’s head inn. 
At this point, do the entire remaining stalvan quest line, all the steps are easy until the final one and just lead you around to various locations in elwynn forest and stormwind.
Train 28 shaman skills while in stormwind.
After the step of “The legend of stalvan” that leads you to the eastvale logging camp, take a brief detour into Redridge to do “An unwelcome guest” and to grab the flightpath for later. Fly back to Darkshire. 
Turn in the remaining steps for the Stalvan line in town, then the last step requires you to head north of town to kill Stalvan Mistmantle for his ring. He’s a lvl 32 mob, but you can kill him at 29. Should be right around 29 by now, but if not, grind it out in the area on worgen/ghouls while working on pt 2 of “worgen in the woods.”
After killing him and turning in the quest at darkshire, take the blue 1h axe reward. This will be our main weapon for a long time unless you plan to twink out your sham with AH weapons or do dungeon runs.
Do “worgen in the woods” part 2 while traveling back to the NW area of the zone again.
Mass grind time, finish all of “Proving your worth,” “The night watch pt3,” “Ghoulish Effigy” and “Totem of Infliction.” Many of these quests overlap with each-other somewhat, and we’re much stronger now with the blue axe so we saved them all for now. 
Turn in/get followups for the Sven and Abercrombie quest lines.
Go south to do “Ogre Thieves” and final part of “Look to the Stars” by the ogre cave.
Return to Abercrombie to turn in/accept next quest.
Hearth or run back to Darkshire.
Turn in all quests/accept next in chains, should be about 30 by this point.
Keep an eye out for the *quest starter* item “An old History Book,” or check your bags for it if you haven’t already started the quest. It’s a random drop off any mob in duskwood, turn it in next time you’re in stormwind if you find it, the other steps in the chain are worth doing.
Fly to Stormwind to train lvl 30 skills and to turn in “Seeking Wisdom.” 
Windfury is now our primary weapon augment till 60 except for rare situations.
Due to the new tbc talent “Shamanistic Focus,” critting more often is of great importance, so even if it does less damage than flametongue at certain levels, windfury is better.
Pick up “The missing diplomat” here as well and complete the steps until it leads you back to Darkshire. 
Pick up “Malin’s request” from the mage quarter and buy some Ankhs for reincarnation at a reagent vendor.
Hearth/Recall back to Darkshire (Now that you have Astral Recall, shamans have essentially unlimited hearthstones. 15m cooldown AND you can just use your normal hearth instead when Recall is down - they have separate cooldowns.) 
Complete the final part of “Worgen In the Woods” to the southwest of town.
Complete the “Bride of the Embalmer” quest to finish Abercrombie’s chain.
(Optional) Can attempt to kill Mor’Ladim now, or wait till 34 when heading south into STV
Complete “The missing diplomat” step that has you obtain the Defias Docket.
Recall to Darkshire and turn everything in, take the shield from “Bride of the Embalmer,” we’ll be using it until dual wield is unlocked. You may have to go north of town to find the npc for “the missing diplomat,” he patrols. 
Fly back to stormwind for a few more steps in “The missing diplomat” chain, continue the chain until the next step sends you to Menethil Harbor.
Fly to Menethil harbor.
