During pre-patch you could win an AV match for a blue weapon reward, currently it doesn’t seem possible to get into the 51-60 bracket as there aren’t enough people to start a match. It is still worth heading to the open-world AV area for manna biscuits and the easy quest turn-in though.

Turn in “A sovereign Imperative” and buy about 10 stacks of Manna Biscuits.
Turn in “A call to arms: The Plaguelands,” and take “Clear the Way”
Complete it and turn in, unlocks the cauldron and watchtower quests.
Do the first cauldron quest, “Target: felstone field” and pick up “Better late than never.”
*note* these couple quests can be quite difficult for 51, take care on pulls.
Turn in “Better late than never” at the box in the barn and take next step.
Do “Return to Chillwind Camp”
Hearth/Recall to Ironforge (after completing the AV quest if you’re doing it)
