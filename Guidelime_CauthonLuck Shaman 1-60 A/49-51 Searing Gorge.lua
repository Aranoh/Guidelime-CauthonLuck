Fly to Thorium Point.
Pick up every quest at Thorium Point.
Pick up and progress the “Divine Retribution” quest chain.
Do “The flawless flame”
Do “Forging the Shaft,” while working on other quests and turning in “Dwarven Justice” down in the mines.
Turn in “Dwarven Justice” and accept “Release Them.” 
Turn in “Forging the Shaft” and accept “The Flame’s Casing.”
At this point you can pick up “Prayer to Elune” and do all 3 quests in the same area at the same time, killing the same mobs now. (prayer/flame’s casing/release them)
Finish every remaining quest in the zone, except for “Ledger from Tanaris” and “The Horn of the Beast,” they all occupy the same general areas and have some overlap in mobs. The Quests mobs that were previously elite in classic are normal now.
Keep an eye out for the *quest starter* “grimesilt outhouse key” for bonus XP at the outhouse where we did “caught!” earlier.
Hold onto the black dragon molt you get at the end of the “Divine Retribution” chain until later for a quest in Burning Steppes.
Recall Iron forge to turn in “Rise, Obsidian,” train class skills, and pick up “A call to arms: The Plaguelands,” “A sovereign Imperative,” and “A little slime goes a long way.”
Should be 51 at this point, if not then either grind it out, do some cloth turn-ins, or skip ahead to one of the next sections and get 51 before traveling up to Alterac Valley.
